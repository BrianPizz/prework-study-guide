# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

My goal for this project was to provide Bootcamp students with access to a prework study guide covering HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I wanted to give students access to a tool that utilizes the same content it explains, to give students an application of the study materials. Any student who needs help or is having problems understanding a prework topic can view this study guide for assistance. Creating this webpage has enhanced my understaning of HTML/CSS, brought practice of using Git and Github, as well as introduced me to JavaScript.
